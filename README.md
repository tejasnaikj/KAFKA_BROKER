Introduction
This repository contains Python code for implementing a simple Kafka broker using sockets and SSL/TLS encryption. The Kafka broker allows for basic functionality such as creating topics, subscribing to topics, publishing messages to topics, and consuming messages from topics.

Code Structure
The repository consists of the following files:

kafka_broker.py: Contains the implementation of the KafkaBroker class, which represents the Kafka broker server.
publisher.py: Python script for simulating a publisher client that can create topics and publish messages to topics on the Kafka broker.
consumer.py: Python script for simulating a consumer client that can subscribe to topics and consume messages from topics on the Kafka broker.
Usage
To use the Kafka broker and client scripts:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Start the Kafka broker server by running python kafka_broker.py.
Run the publisher.py script to create topics and publish messages.
Run the consumer.py script to subscribe to topics and consume messages.
Important Notes
The Kafka broker and clients use SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication. Make sure to generate the necessary SSL certificates (server-cert.pem, server-key.pem, ca-cert.pem) before running the scripts.
Update the broker address (broker_address) in the client scripts (publisher.py and consumer.py) to match the IP address and port of your Kafka broker server.
The provided implementation is a basic version of a Kafka broker and clients for educational purposes. It lacks many features present in a production-grade Kafka system, such as fault tolerance, partitioning, and replication.

Acknowledgments
The implementation of the Kafka broker and clients is inspired by the Apache Kafka distributed streaming platform. Special thanks to the Apache Kafka community for their valuable contributions.
